# Conv4D
4D convolution relying on TF2 and Sonnet.

This repository extend an [existing tf implementation](https://github.com/funkey/conv4d) with an OOP point of view along with support for strides and padding. I chose to base myself on the sonnet convolution implementation for increased flexibility on the padding function.

I thank the authors of [this excellent pytorch general implementation](https://github.com/pvjosue/pytorch_convNd/blob/master/convNd.py) this implementation is roughly a tf translation.
